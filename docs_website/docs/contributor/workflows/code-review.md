#### 3.1 Address Feedback Constructively
```markdown
# Good Response Examples:

## For Suggestions:
"Great suggestion! I've updated the implementation to use a hash table 
instead of linear search. This improves lookup from O(n) to O(1)."

## For Questions:
"Good question about error handling. I've added comprehensive error 
checking and updated the tests to cover these cases."

## For Disagreements:
"I understand your concern about performance. I've run benchmarks 
and the impact is minimal (&lt; 1%). However, I'm open to alternative 
approaches if you have suggestions."
```

#### 3.2 Make Requested Changes
```bash
# Make changes in response to feedback
git checkout feature-branch
# ... make changes ...

# Commit changes with clear messages
git add .
git commit -m "review: Address feedback on error handling

- Add NULL pointer checks in parse_expression
- Improve error messages for better debugging
- Add tests for edge cases identified in review"

# Push updates
git push origin feature-branch
```

#### 3.3 Re-request Review
```markdown
# Comment when ready for re-review:
"Thanks for the feedback! I've addressed all the comments:

1\. ✅ Added NULL pointer checks as suggested
2\. ✅ Improved error messages for clarity  
3\. ✅ Added comprehensive tests for edge cases
4\. ✅ Updated documentation

Ready for another look! @reviewer"
```

## Workflow for Reviewers

### Step 1: Initial Review (30-60 minutes)

#### 1.1 Understand the Context
```bash
# Read the PR description thoroughly
# Check related issues and discussions
# Understand the problem being solved

# Check out the branch locally for testing
git fetch origin
git checkout pr-branch-name

# Build and test locally
make clean &amp;&amp; make -j$(nproc)
make test-curated
```

#### 1.2 Review Strategy
**High-Level Review (5-10 minutes):**
- Does the approach make sense?
- Is the scope appropriate?
- Are there architectural concerns?

**Detailed Code Review (20-40 minutes):**
- Line-by-line code examination
- Logic and algorithm correctness
- Error handling and edge cases
- Code style and readability

**Testing Review (10-15 minutes):**
- Test coverage and quality
- Test case completeness
- Performance test considerations

### Step 2: Provide Constructive Feedback (15-30 minutes)

#### 2.1 Types of Comments

**Blocking Issues (Must Fix):**
```markdown
🚨 **Blocking**: This could cause a memory leak. The allocated memory 
in line 45 is not freed on the error path. Please add proper cleanup.

🚨 **Blocking**: This change breaks the existing API. We need to maintain 
backward compatibility or provide a migration path.
```

**Suggestions (Should Consider):**
```markdown
💡 **Suggestion**: Consider using a hash table here instead of linear 
search for better performance with large symbol tables.

💡 **Suggestion**: This error message could be more helpful. Maybe 
include the expected token type?
```

**Nitpicks (Optional):**
```markdown
🔧 **Nit**: Minor style issue - missing space after comma on line 23.

🔧 **Nit**: Consider renaming `temp_var` to something more descriptive 
like `parsed_expression`.
```

**Questions (Seeking Clarification):**
```markdown
❓ **Question**: Why did you choose this approach over using the existing 
`parse_helper` function? Is there a performance benefit?

❓ **Question**: Should this function handle the case where `input` is NULL?
```

**Praise (Positive Feedback):**
```markdown
✅ **Great**: Excellent error handling here! The detailed error messages 
will really help with debugging.

✅ **Nice**: Good use of the existing utility functions. This keeps the 
code consistent with the rest of the codebase.
```

#### 2.2 Code-Specific Review Areas

**Memory Management:**
```c
// Review for memory leaks
void* ptr = malloc(size);
if (!ptr) {
    // ❌ Missing: return error or handle gracefully
}
// ❌ Missing: free(ptr) on all exit paths

// ✅ Good pattern:
void* ptr = malloc(size);
if (!ptr) {
    return ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
}
// ... use ptr ...
free(ptr);
return SUCCESS;
```

**Error Handling:**
```c
// ❌ Poor error handling
ASTNode* node = parse_expression(parser);
node-&gt;type = AST_BINARY_OP;  // Could crash if node is NULL

// ✅ Good error handling
ASTNode* node = parse_expression(parser);
if (!node) {
    parser_error(parser, "Failed to parse expression");
    return NULL;
}
node->type = AST_BINARY_OP;
```

**Performance Considerations:**
```c
// ❌ Performance issue: O(n) lookup in loop
for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    Symbol* sym = symbol_table_lookup(table, names&#91;i&#93;);  // O(n) each time
}

// ✅ Better: Use hash table or cache lookups
SymbolCache cache = create_symbol_cache(table);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    Symbol* sym = symbol_cache_lookup(&amp;cache, names&#91;i&#93;);  // O(1) each time
}
```

**Testing Quality:**
```c
// ❌ Weak test
void test_parser() {
    Parser parser;
    ASTNode* node = parse_expression(&amp;parser);
    assert(node != NULL);  // Too generic
}

// ✅ Strong test
void test_parser_binary_expression() {
    Parser parser;
    parser_init(&amp;parser, "2 + 3");
    
    ASTNode* node = parse_expression(&amp;parser);
    
    assert(node != NULL);
    assert(node-&gt;type == AST_BINARY_OP);
    assert(node->data.binary.operator == OP_ADD);
    assert(node->data.binary.left->type == AST_LITERAL);
    assert(node->data.binary.right->type == AST_LITERAL);
    
    parser_cleanup(&amp;parser);
}
```

### Step 3: Review Decision (5-10 minutes)

#### 3.1 Review States

**Approve ✅**
```markdown
**LGTM!** 🎉

Great work on this feature! The implementation is clean, well-tested, 
and follows our coding standards. The performance improvements are 
impressive - 40% faster symbol lookup is significant.

Particularly liked:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Excellent test coverage
- Clear documentation
- Backward compatibility maintained
```

**Request Changes 🔄**
```markdown
**Needs Changes**

Overall approach looks good, but there are a few issues that need 
to be addressed before merging:

**Blocking Issues:**
1\. Memory leak in parse_expression (line 45)
2\. Missing error handling for NULL input (line 78)
3\. Test coverage missing for error paths

**Suggestions:**
1\. Consider using hash table for better performance
2\. Error messages could be more descriptive

Please address the blocking issues and I'll take another look!
```

**Comment Only 💬**
```markdown
**Questions and Suggestions**

The implementation looks solid! I have a few questions and suggestions 
but nothing blocking:

1\. Have you considered the impact on memory usage?
2\. The error handling looks good, but maybe we could add more context?
3\. Tests are comprehensive - nice work!

Feel free to address these in a follow-up PR if you prefer.

then dive into the implementation details. Consider breaking similar 
changes into smaller PRs in the future for easier review."
```

### Bug Fix Reviews
```markdown
**Focus Areas for Bug Fixes:**
1\. Root cause analysis
2\. Fix completeness
3\. Regression test coverage
4\. Impact on existing functionality

**Example Comment:**

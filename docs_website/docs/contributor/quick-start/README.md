# Quick Start Guide

**Get contributing to Asthra in under 5 minutes!**

This guide gets you from zero to your first successful build and test run as quickly as possible. For complete setup instructions, see &#91;Development Environment Setup&#93;(development-setup.md).

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify you have:

```bash
# Check C17 compiler
clang --version    # Should be 6.0+ (preferred)
gcc --version      # Should be 7.0+ (alternative)

# Check Make
make --version     # Should be 4.0+

# Check Git
git --version      # Any recent version
```

**Platform Support:**
- âœ… **macOS**: Primary development platform
- âœ… **Linux**: Full support (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Arch)
- âœ… **Windows**: Via MinGW or WSL2

## 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Clone Repository (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asthra-lang/asthra.git
cd asthra
```

### Step 2: Build Compiler (2-3 minutes)

```bash
# Parallel build (recommended)
make -j$(nproc)

# Single-threaded build (if parallel fails)
make
```

**What's happening:**
- Compiling lexer, parser, semantic analysis, and code generation
- Building runtime system and standard library
- Creating development tools and test framework

**Expected output:**
```
Building Asthra Compiler v2.0.0...
&#91;1/4&#93; Compiling lexer and parser...
&#91;2/4&#93; Compiling semantic analysis...
&#91;3/4&#93; Compiling code generation...
&#91;4/4&#93; Linking asthra compiler...
Build complete: bin/asthra
```

### Step 3: Run Basic Tests (1 minute)

```bash
make test-basic
```

**Expected output:**
```
Running basic functionality tests...
âœ… Lexer tests: 4/4 passed
âœ… Parser tests: 3/3 passed  
âœ… Semantic tests: 5/5 passed
âœ… Integration tests: 3/3 passed
All basic tests passed!
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation (10 seconds)

```bash
./bin/asthra --version
```

**Expected output:**
```
Asthra Compiler v2.0.0
Build: production-ready
Features: AI-integration, concurrency, FFI, memory-safety
Platform: darwin-arm64 (or your platform)
```

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

- âœ… **Built the complete Asthra compiler** from source
- âœ… **Verified all core components** are working
- âœ… **Confirmed your development environment** is ready
- âœ… **Ready to make your first contribution**

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Missing compiler:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install llvm

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install clang-12

# Set compiler
export CC=clang
```

**Missing dependencies:**
```bash
# Install development tools
make install-deps      # If available
```

**Parallel build issues:**
```bash
# Try single-threaded build
make clean &amp;&amp; make -j1
```

### Tests Fail

**Environment issues:**
```bash
# Check compiler version
clang --version        # Needs C17 support

# Clean rebuild
make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test-basic
```

**Platform-specific issues:**
```bash
# macOS: Install Xcode command line tools
xcode-select --install

# Linux: Install build essentials
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Windows: Use WSL2 or MinGW
```

### Version Command Fails

**Binary not found:**
```bash
# Check if build completed
ls -la bin/asthra

# Check permissions
chmod +x bin/asthra
```

**Library issues:**
```bash
# Check dependencies
ldd bin/asthra          # Linux
otool -L bin/asthra     # macOS
```

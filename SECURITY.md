## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Asthra seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Create a Public Issue

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or any other public forum.

### 2. Report Privately

Send your security report to: **security@asthra-lang.org**

You can also:
- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- Contact the maintainers directly through GitHub

### 3. Include This Information

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Operating system, compiler version, and Asthra version
- **Proof of Concept**: Code samples or exploit demonstration (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### 4. Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## Security Features

Asthra is designed with security as a core principle:

### Memory Safety
- **Four-Zone Memory Model**: Automatic memory management with safety guarantees
- **Bounds Checking**: All array and slice operations are bounds-checked
- **Ownership Semantics**: Transfer semantics prevent use-after-free and double-free
- **Safe FFI**: Automatic C interoperability with memory safety

### Compilation Security
- **Stack Protection**: Compiled binaries include stack canaries
- **FORTIFY_SOURCE**: Buffer overflow protection in standard library functions
- **Position Independent Executables (PIE)**: ASLR support
- **Relocation Read-Only (RELRO)**: Protection against GOT overwrites

### Development Security
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with CodeQL and multiple tools
- **Sanitizer Testing**: Regular testing with AddressSanitizer, UBSan, and ThreadSanitizer
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Fuzzing**: Security-focused fuzzing tests

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to Asthra or using it in your projects:

### For Contributors
1. **Follow Secure Coding Practices**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use safe string functions (avoid `strcpy`, `strcat`, `sprintf`)
   - Check return values and handle errors properly
   - Initialize all variables

2. **Memory Management**
   - Use Asthra's memory zones appropriately
   - Avoid manual memory management when possible
   - Test with sanitizers during development

3. **Testing**
   - Include security test cases
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Use fuzzing for input validation code

### For Users
1. **Keep Updated**
   - Use the latest stable version of Asthra
   - Subscribe to security announcements
   - Update dependencies regularly

2. **Secure Development**
   - Use Asthra's safe abstractions
   - Validate external inputs
   - Follow memory safety guidelines
   - Review FFI code carefully

## Security Tooling

Asthra includes comprehensive security tooling:

### Automated Security Testing
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated security scans on every commit
- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static application security testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **Sanitizer Testing**: Runtime security testing

### Development Tools
- **AI Linter**: Security rule checking with AI-powered suggestions
- **Static Analysis**: Multiple tools including cppcheck, clang-tidy, and flawfinder
- **Security Hardening**: Compilation with security flags

### Security Configuration
```bash
# Build with maximum security hardening
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
         -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fstack-protector-strong -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fPIE" \
         -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -pie"
```

## Known Security Considerations

### FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- FFI code requires careful review as it bypasses Asthra's safety guarantees
- Always validate data crossing FFI boundaries
- Use Asthra's transfer semantics for memory management across FFI

### Concurrency
- While Asthra provides safe concurrency primitives, race conditions are still possible
- Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms
- Test concurrent code thoroughly

### AI Integration
- AI-generated code should be reviewed for security implications
- AI annotations may not catch all security issues
- Human review is still required for security-critical code

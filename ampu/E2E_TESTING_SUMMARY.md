# End-to-End Testing Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

I've successfully implemented a **comprehensive hybrid testing framework** for both the Ampu CLI tool and Asthra language features using the recommended `assert_cmd` approach for testing command-line applications in Rust.

## Hybrid Testing Approach

### Why Two Types of Tests?

**CLI Tests (`e2e_tests.rs`)**
- **Purpose**: Test the `ampu` build tool functionality
- **Focus**: Command-line interface, project management, build orchestration
- **Examples**: `ampu init`, `ampu build`, `ampu clean`, error handling

**Language Tests (`language_tests.rs`)**
- **Purpose**: Test Asthra language features and semantics as defined in the specification
- **Focus**: Syntax parsing, type checking, code generation, language compliance
- **Examples**: Function declarations, type inference, string operations, FFI

This hybrid approach ensures comprehensive coverage of both the **build tool** and the **programming language** itself, addressing the gap identified in testing language features from the specification.

## Files Created

### 1. `tests/e2e_tests.rs` (CLI Functionality Tests)
- **18 test functions** covering complete CLI tool functionality
- Uses the recommended `assert_cmd` approach for clean, maintainable tests
- Organized into logical sections:
  - Core CLI functionality (version, help, error handling)
  - Project management (initialization, library creation, validation)
  - Build and validation (access control, TOML parsing)
  - Dependency management (listing, cleaning)
  - Environment and configuration (custom env vars)
  - Workflow and integration (complete project lifecycle)
  - Performance and stress testing (timing, concurrency)
  - Special cases (interactive stdin when needed)

### 2. `tests/language_tests.rs` (Asthra Language Feature Tests)
- **19 test functions** covering Asthra language features from the specification
- Tests actual language semantics, not just CLI functionality
- Organized by specification sections:
  - **Basic syntax**: Function declarations, imports, package declarations
  - **Type system**: Primitive types, slices, pointers, Result types (spec sections 4, 6.1)
  - **String operations**: Concatenation and interpolation (spec section 6)
  - **FFI and memory model**: Extern functions, ownership annotations (spec section 3)
  - **Control flow**: If/else, loops, pattern matching
  - **Observability**: Built-in logging primitives (spec section 7)
  - **Access control**: Import restrictions (spec section 1.6)
  - **Build integration**: Complete Asthra source to executable compilation
  - **Type inference**: Go-style inference system (spec section 6.1)
  - **Error cases**: Invalid syntax, type mismatches, language restrictions

### 3. `tests/README.md` (Comprehensive Documentation)
- Updated to document the hybrid testing approach
- Clear guidance on when to use each type of test
- Focus on the recommended `assert_cmd` approach
- Best practices and testing patterns for both CLI and language testing

### 4. `TESTING_RECOMMENDATION.md` (Approach Guide)
- Clear guidance on when to use `assert_cmd` vs `std::process::Command`
- Migration strategies and practical examples
- Performance and maintainability benefits

### 5. `run_e2e_tests.sh` (Comprehensive Test Runner)
- Updated to run both CLI and language tests
- Organized test categories with clear output
- Progress tracking and result summaries for both test types
- Detailed reporting on what's working vs. what needs implementation

## Dependencies Added

Updated `Cargo.toml` with essential e2e testing dependencies:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
tempfile = "3.0"        # Temporary files and directories
tokio-test = "0.4"      # Async testing utilities  
assert_cmd = "2.0"      # Ergonomic CLI testing
predicates = "3.1"      # Powerful assertion predicates
```

## Testing Framework Validation

### âœ… Framework Validation Results

**CLI Tests**: Working correctly
- Version and help commands pass
- Error handling for invalid commands works
- Environment variable support functional
- Basic CLI argument parsing operational

**Language Tests**: Framework operational
- Test infrastructure successfully creates Asthra projects
- `ampu check` command integration working
- Proper error detection for invalid configurations
- Ready to test language features as they're implemented

### Language Feature Test Coverage

The language tests comprehensively cover the Asthra specification:

```rust
// Example: Testing string concatenation (spec section 6)
#[test]
fn test_string_concatenation() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let asthra_code = r#"
package main;

fn test_string_ops() -> void {
    let name: string = "World";
    let greeting: string = "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

fn main() -> i32 {
    test_string_ops();
    return 0;
}
"#;

    let temp_dir = create_asthra_project_with_source("string-concat-test", asthra_code)?;
    let project_path = temp_dir.path().join("string-concat-test");

    AssertCommand::cargo_bin("ampu")?
        .arg("check")
        .current_dir(&project_path)
        .assert()
        .success();

    Ok(())
}
```

## Key Testing Patterns Implemented

### 1. CLI Test Patterns
```rust
// CLI success testing
AssertCommand::cargo_bin("ampu")?
    .arg("--version")
    .assert()
    .success()
    .stdout(predicate::str::contains("ampu"));

// CLI error testing
AssertCommand::cargo_bin("ampu")?
    .arg("nonexistent-command")
    .assert()
    .failure()
    .stderr(predicate::str::contains("error"));
```

### 2. Language Feature Test Patterns
```rust
// Language syntax testing
let asthra_code = r#"
package main;
fn main() -> i32 { return 0; }
"#;

let temp_dir = create_asthra_project_with_source("test", asthra_code)?;
AssertCommand::cargo_bin("ampu")?
    .arg("check")
    .current_dir(&temp_dir.path().join("test"))
    .assert()
    .success();

// Language error testing
let invalid_code = r#"
package main;
fn main() -> i32 {
    let number: i32 = "string";  // Type mismatch
    return number;
}
"#;

AssertCommand::cargo_bin("ampu")?
    .arg("check")
    .current_dir(&project_path)
    .assert()
    .failure()
    .stderr(predicate::str::contains("type"));
```

### 3. Test Isolation
```rust
let temp_dir = TempDir::new()?;  // Automatic cleanup
let project_path = temp_dir.path().join(project_name);
```

### 4. Environment Variable Testing
```rust
AssertCommand::cargo_bin("ampu")?
    .args(&["init", project_name])
    .env("AMPU_LOG_LEVEL", "debug")
    .env("AMPU_CACHE_DIR", temp_dir.path().join("custom-cache"))
    .assert()
    .success();
```

## Running the Comprehensive Tests

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Build the project first
cargo build

# Run all tests (both CLI and language)
cargo test

# Run only CLI tests
cargo test --test e2e_tests

# Run only language tests
cargo test --test language_tests

# Use the comprehensive test runner
./run_e2e_tests.sh
```

### Debugging Failed Tests
```bash
# Run with backtraces
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo test

# Run single test with full output
cargo test test_name --test language_tests -- --exact --nocapture
```

## Answer to Your Question

**Is this e2e test framework the best for testing language features as defined in the spec?**

**Yes, with the hybrid approach we now have.** Here's why:

### âœ… What We Fixed
1. **Added Language Feature Tests**: The original framework only tested CLI functionality. We now have comprehensive tests for Asthra language features.

2. **Specification Compliance**: Language tests directly map to specification sections (FFI section 3, string operations section 6, type inference section 6.1, etc.).

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover syntax parsing, type system, memory model, control flow, error handling, and build integration.

4. **Proper Test Organization**: Clear separation between CLI tool testing and language feature testing.

### âœ… Why This Approach is Optimal

1. **Hybrid Strategy**: CLI tests for build tool functionality + Language tests for language features
2. **Specification-Driven**: Language tests directly validate spec requirements
3. **Implementation-Ready**: Tests provide clear guidance on what needs to be built
4. **Maintainable**: Uses consistent `assert_cmd` patterns for both test types
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new tests as language features are implemented

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

The test framework is now ready to guide both:
1. **CLI Development**: Implement `ampu init`, `ampu build`, dependency management
2. **Language Development**: Implement Asthra parser, type checker, code generator

**Conclusion**: This hybrid testing framework is now the optimal approach for testing both the Ampu build tool and Asthra language features as defined in the specification. It provides comprehensive coverage, clear development guidance, and maintains clean, maintainable test code using modern Rust testing practices.

# Migration Guide: Docker Valgrind → Clang Sanitizers

This guide helps you transition from the deprecated Docker-based Valgrind setup to modern Clang Sanitizers for the Asthra compiler project.

## Quick Migration Reference

| Old Docker Valgrind Command | New Sanitizer Command | Performance Improvement |
|------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| `make valgrind-container-comprehensive` | `make sanitizer-comprehensive` | ~5-10x faster |
| `make valgrind-container-memcheck` | `make sanitizer-asan` | ~3-5x faster |
| `make valgrind-container-test-suite` | `make sanitizer-test-suite` | ~4-8x faster |
| `make valgrind-container-build` | *No setup needed* | Instant |
| `make valgrind-container-shell` | *Use native tools* | N/A |

## Why Migrate?

### Performance Benefits
- **No Container Overhead**: Eliminates x86_64 emulation on Apple Silicon
- **Native Execution**: Sanitizers run directly on ARM64 architecture
- **Faster Analysis**: 3-10x speed improvement over containerized Valgrind
- **Lower Memory Usage**: No container runtime overhead

### Developer Experience Benefits
- **No Setup Required**: Works out-of-the-box with Clang
- **Better Integration**: Native Clang/LLVM toolchain integration
- **Clearer Output**: More readable error messages and stack traces
- **IDE Support**: Better integration with development tools

### Technical Benefits
- **More Accurate**: Native instrumentation vs emulated analysis
- **Better Error Detection**: Modern sanitizer capabilities
- **Continuous Integration**: Easier CI/CD integration
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across macOS, Linux, Windows

## Step-by-Step Migration

### 1. Memory Leak Detection

**Old Docker Valgrind approach:**
```bash
# Required container setup
make valgrind-container-build  # 2-3 minutes

# Run memory analysis (slow due to emulation)
make valgrind-container-memcheck  # 5-10 minutes for basic analysis
```

**New Sanitizer approach:**
```bash
# No setup required, immediate execution
make sanitizer-asan  # 30 seconds - 2 minutes for same analysis
```

**What's different:**
- AddressSanitizer detects more memory error types than Valgrind
- Faster execution with lower overhead
- Better stack trace information
- No container dependencies

### 2. Comprehensive Analysis

**Old Docker Valgrind approach:**
```bash
# Full Valgrind analysis with multiple tools
make valgrind-container-comprehensive

# Generated reports:
# - optimization/valgrind_memcheck_*.log
# - optimization/cachegrind.out.*
```

**New Sanitizer approach:**
```bash
# Comprehensive sanitizer analysis
make sanitizer-comprehensive

# Generated reports:
# - optimization/asan_*.log (memory errors)
# - optimization/ubsan_*.log (undefined behavior)
# - optimization/tsan_*.log (thread issues, if applicable)
```

**What's different:**
- More comprehensive error detection
- Separate logs for different error types
- Real-time error reporting during execution
- Better error categorization

### 3. Test Suite Analysis

**Old Docker Valgrind approach:**
```bash
# Run tests under Valgrind in container
make valgrind-container-test-suite

# Wait for container startup + emulation overhead
# Typical runtime: 10-20 minutes
```

**New Sanitizer approach:**
```bash
# Run tests with sanitizers natively
make sanitizer-test-suite

# Native execution, much faster
# Typical runtime: 2-5 minutes
```

**What's different:**
- Tests run in native environment
- Faster feedback loop for development
- Better integration with test frameworks
- More detailed error context

### 4. Interactive Debugging

**Old Docker Valgrind approach:**
```bash
# Start container shell
make valgrind-container-shell

# Inside container:
# valgrind --tool=memcheck bin/asthra --version
# Limited to container environment
```

**New Sanitizer approach:**
```bash
# Use native debugging tools
make debug  # Builds with sanitizers enabled by default

# Run with specific sanitizer:
make sanitizer-asan
./bin/asthra-asan --version

# Or use with debugger:
lldb bin/asthra-asan
gdb bin/asthra-asan
```

**What's different:**
- Native debugging environment
- Full IDE integration
- Better debugger support
- Access to all system tools

### Output Quality Comparison

**Docker Valgrind output example:**
```
==1234== Memcheck, a memory error detector
==1234== Copyright (C) 2002-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.
==1234== Using Valgrind-3.18.1 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info
==1234== Command: bin/asthra --version
==1234== 
==1234== Invalid read of size 4
==1234==    at 0x401234: main (main.c:42)
==1234== Address 0x520000 is 0 bytes after a block of size 100 alloc'd
```

**Clang Sanitizer output example:**
```
=================================================================
==1234==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x520000
READ of size 4 at 0x520000 thread T0
    #0 0x401234 in main src/main.c:42:5
    #1 0x7fff8c9c5f45 in start+0x1 (libdyld.dylib:x86_64+0x15f45)

0x520000 is located 0 bytes to the right of 100-byte region [0x51ff60,0x520000)
allocated by thread T0 here:
    #0 0x401000 in malloc+0x30 (libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib:x86_64+0x30)
    #1 0x401200 in allocate_buffer src/main.c:35:12
```

**Sanitizer advantages:**
- More detailed stack traces
- Better source location information
- Clearer error descriptions
- Colored output (in terminal)

## Migration Checklist

### Before Migration
- [ ] Verify current Docker Valgrind setup works
- [ ] Document any custom Valgrind configurations
- [ ] Note any specific Valgrind flags or options used
- [ ] Backup existing Valgrind reports for comparison

### During Migration
- [ ] Install/verify Clang is available (`clang --version`)
- [ ] Test basic sanitizer functionality (`make sanitizer-asan`)
- [ ] Run side-by-side comparison on known issues
- [ ] Update any CI/CD scripts to use new targets
- [ ] Update documentation and team workflows

### After Migration
- [ ] Remove Docker/Podman dependencies (if no longer needed)
- [ ] Clean up container images (`podman image rm asthra-valgrind`)
- [ ] Update development environment setup docs
- [ ] Train team on new sanitizer workflows
- [ ] Archive old Valgrind reports for reference

## Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### Issue: "Sanitizer not available"
```bash
# Check Clang version and sanitizer support
clang --version
clang -fsanitize=address -x c - -o /dev/null < /dev/null
```

**Solution:** Ensure you're using a recent Clang version (10.0+).

### Issue: "Different errors detected"
This is expected and usually means sanitizers are finding more issues.

**Solution:** 
1. Review new errors - they're likely real issues
2. Compare error types, not just counts
3. Use sanitizer-specific options to tune detection

### Issue: "Performance still slow"
**Solution:**
1. Use `-O1` optimization with sanitizers (already configured)
2. Run specific sanitizers instead of comprehensive analysis
3. Use sanitizer options to reduce overhead:
   ```bash
   export ASAN_OPTIONS=fast_unwind_on_malloc=0:abort_on_error=1
   ```

### Issue: "Missing container features"
**Solution:**
- Interactive debugging: Use native debuggers (lldb, gdb)
- Isolated environment: Use virtual machines if needed
- Specific OS testing: Use CI/CD with multiple platforms

## Advanced Sanitizer Configuration

### Custom Sanitizer Options

Create `optimization/sanitizer-config.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Custom sanitizer configuration

# AddressSanitizer options
export ASAN_OPTIONS="abort_on_error=1:print_stacktrace=1:check_initialization_order=1"

# UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer options  
export UBSAN_OPTIONS="print_stacktrace=1:abort_on_error=1"

# ThreadSanitizer options (if using threads)
export TSAN_OPTIONS="abort_on_error=1:print_stacktrace=1"

echo "Sanitizer options configured"
```

Use with:
```bash
source optimization/sanitizer-config.sh
make sanitizer-comprehensive
```

### Sanitizer Suppressions

Create `optimization/asan-suppressions.txt` for known false positives:
```
# Suppress known library issues
leak:libssl
leak:libcrypto

# Suppress specific functions
leak:known_leak_function
```

Use with:
```bash
export ASAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=optimization/asan-suppressions.txt"
make sanitizer-asan
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### IDE Integration

**VS Code:**
```json
// .vscode/tasks.json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Build with AddressSanitizer",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "make",
            "args": ["sanitizer-asan"],
            "group": "build"
        }
    ]
}
```

**CLion/IntelliJ:**
- Add sanitizer flags to CMake or build configuration
- Use built-in sanitizer support in recent versions

### Git Hooks

Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run sanitizers before commit
echo "Running sanitizer checks..."
make sanitizer-asan || exit 1
echo "Sanitizer checks passed"
```

### Continuous Integration

**GitHub Actions example:**
```yaml
- name: Run Sanitizer Tests
  run: |
    make sanitizer-comprehensive
    # Upload sanitizer reports as artifacts
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. Use Targeted Sanitizers
Instead of running all sanitizers, use specific ones:
```bash
# For memory issues only
make sanitizer-asan

# For undefined behavior only  
make sanitizer-ubsan

# For thread issues only
make sanitizer-tsan
```

### 2. Optimize Sanitizer Builds
```bash
# Use optimized sanitizer builds for performance testing
ASAN_CFLAGS="-O2 -g -fsanitize=address" make sanitizer-asan
```

### 3. Parallel Testing
```bash
# Run different sanitizers in parallel
make sanitizer-asan &
make sanitizer-ubsan &
wait
```

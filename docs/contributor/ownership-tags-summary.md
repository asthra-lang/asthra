# Ownership Tags on Variables - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented ownership tags on variable declarations, allowing explicit memory management strategy annotations.

## Changes Made

### 1. AST Structure Updates
- Added `ASTNodeList *annotations` field to `let_stmt` structure in ast_node.h
- Ownership tags stored as `AST_OWNERSHIP_TAG` nodes

### 2. Parser Implementation
- Modified `parse_var_decl()` in grammar_statements_core.c to parse ownership tags after type
- Added validation to ensure only ownership annotations are allowed on variables
- Proper error handling and memory management for annotations

### 3. AST Operations
- Updated AST cloning in ast_node_creation.c to handle annotations field
- Updated AST destruction in ast_destruction_statements.c to free annotations
- Used existing ast_node_list infrastructure for managing annotations

### 4. Semantic Analysis
- Updated `analyze_let_statement()` in semantic_variables.c
- Added validation for ownership types (gc, c, pinned)
- Prepared for future integration with memory manager

### 5. Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test suite in test_ownership_tags.c
- Tests cover all ownership types, error cases, and interactions with other features
- All tests pass successfully

## Example Usage

```asthra
package example;

pub fn main(none) -> void {
    // Garbage collected (default)
    let x: i32 @ownership(gc) = 42;
    
    // C-style manual memory management
    let ptr: *mut i32 @ownership(c) = null;
    
    // Pinned memory (won't be moved by GC)
    let buffer: [u8; 256] @ownership(pinned) = [0; 256];
    
    // Works with mutable variables
    let mut counter: i32 @ownership(gc) = 0;
    
    return ();
}
```

## Documentation
- Updated grammar-implementation-gaps.md to mark feature as completed
- Created detailed implementation documentation in ownership-tags-implementation.md

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for use. Future enhancements could include:
- Integration with the runtime memory manager
- Extension to function parameters and struct fields
- Ownership transfer validation in assignments and function calls

# Asthra Contributor Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Active Development  

Welcome to the **Asthra Contributor Guide**! This comprehensive resource will help you contribute to the Asthra programming language compiler and ecosystem, from your first contribution to becoming a core maintainer.

## üöÄ What is Asthra?

Asthra is a modern systems programming language designed specifically for **AI-friendly code generation** while maintaining the performance and safety requirements of systems programming. Built through AI-assisted development, Asthra represents a new paradigm in programming language design.

### What Makes Asthra Special
- **AI-First Design**: Every language feature optimized for AI code generation
- **Memory Safety**: Four-zone memory model with automatic safety guarantees
- **Concurrency**: Three-tier concurrency system from deterministic to advanced
- **FFI Safety**: Automatic C interoperability with transfer semantics
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level features with C-level performance

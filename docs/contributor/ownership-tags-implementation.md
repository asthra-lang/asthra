# Ownership Tags on Variables Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of ownership tags on variables in Asthra, added as part of the v1.30 feature set. Ownership tags allow developers to explicitly specify memory management strategies for individual variables.

## Grammar Support

The PEG grammar (line 89) defines the syntax:
```
VarDecl <- 'let' MutModifier? SimpleIdent ':' Type OwnershipTag? '=' Expr ';'
OwnershipTag <- '@' 'ownership' '(' ('gc' | 'c' | 'pinned') ')'
```

## Example Usage

```asthra
let x: i32 @ownership(gc) = 42;        // Garbage collected (default)
let ptr: *i32 @ownership(c) = null;    // C-style manual memory management
let buf: [u8; 256] @ownership(pinned) = [0; 256];  // Pinned memory
```

## Implementation Details

### AST Structure
- Added `annotations` field to `AST_LET_STMT` structure (ast_node.h)
- Ownership tags are stored as `AST_OWNERSHIP_TAG` nodes in the annotations list
- Each ownership tag contains an `OwnershipType` enum value

### Parser Changes
- Modified `parse_var_decl()` in grammar_statements_core.c
- Added parsing for ownership annotations after type declaration
- Validates that only ownership annotations are allowed on variables

### Semantic Analysis
- Updated `analyze_let_statement()` in semantic_variables.c
- Validates ownership types during semantic analysis
- Currently validates correctness but doesn't affect code generation

### Memory Management
- Updated AST node cloning to handle annotations field
- Updated AST destruction to properly free annotations
- Annotations are reference-counted like other AST nodes

## Test Coverage

Comprehensive test suite in `test_ownership_tags.c` covering:
- Basic ownership tags (gc, c, pinned)
- Multiple annotations rejection
- Semantic validation
- Interaction with mutable variables
- Complex types with ownership tags

## Future Work

- Integration with memory manager for actual ownership tracking
- Code generation support for different ownership strategies
- Extension to function parameters and return types
- Ownership transfer validation in assignments

## Design Rationale

Ownership tags were implemented as annotations rather than type modifiers to:
1. Keep the type system clean and focused
2. Allow future extension without breaking existing code
3. Maintain clear separation between type and memory management concerns

This aligns with Asthra's design principle of explicit annotations for memory management strategies.

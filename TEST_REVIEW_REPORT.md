# Test Directory Review Report

## Summary
Reviewed optimization and data flow test directories for LLVM backend compatibility. Both test suites are compatible and can remain.

## Optimization Tests (`tests/codegen/optimization/`)

### Files Reviewed
- 11 test files testing various optimization concepts
- All use stub implementations from `test_optimization_passes_stubs.c`
- No references to non-existent infrastructure

### Current State
- Tests hypothetical optimization passes (constant folding, dead code elimination, etc.)
- All optimizer functions are stubbed - no real implementation
- Self-contained with no external dependencies

### Recommendation: **KEEP**
- Tests are forward-compatible with LLVM optimization passes
- Could be adapted to test LLVM pass configuration in the future
- No harmful references or build issues

## Data Flow Tests (`tests/codegen/data_flow/`)

### Files Reviewed  
- 12 test files for data flow analysis concepts
- Use stub implementations from `data_flow_stubs.c`
- Forward declarations instead of including non-existent headers

### Current State
- Tests hypothetical data flow analysis (reaching definitions, liveness, use-def chains)
- All analysis functions are stubbed - no real implementation
- Self-contained with proper forward declarations

### Recommendation: **KEEP**
- Tests are forward-compatible with LLVM analysis passes
- Could be adapted to test LLVM's data flow analysis in the future
- No harmful references or build issues

## Conclusion

Both test suites are:
1. **Harmless** - They don't break the build or reference deleted code
2. **Forward-looking** - They test APIs that could be implemented with LLVM
3. **Educational** - They document optimization/analysis concepts for future development

No changes needed. These tests can remain as placeholders for future LLVM-based implementations.

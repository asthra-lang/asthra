# Cleanup Execution Report

## Summary
Successfully removed **47 obsolete test files** that were testing non-existent code generation infrastructure.

## Files Removed

### Phase 1: Codegen Tests (4 files)
- `tests/codegen/integration/test_code_generator.c`
- `tests/codegen/integration/test_simple_arithmetic.c`
- `tests/codegen/integration/test_multiline_string_codegen.c`
- `tests/codegen/integration/test_phase5_simple.c`

### Phase 2: FFI Tests (18 files)
- `tests/ffi/test_ffi_simple.c`
- `tests/ffi/test_ffi_complete.c`
- `tests/ffi/test_option_ffi.c`
- 15 FFI assembly test files (`test_ffi_assembly_*.c`)

### Phase 3: Test Stub Headers (19 files)
- All `codegen_test_stubs.h` files across various subdirectories

### Phase 4: Symbol Export Tests (4 files)
- All symbol export tests that depended on old assembly backend

### Phase 5: Examples (2 files)
- `examples/test_codegen.c`
- `examples/test_optimizer.c`

### Phase 6: Other Files (3 files)
- `tests/codegen/cross_platform/cross_platform_common.h`
- `tests/immutable_by_default/legacy_stubs.c`
- `tests/immutable_by_default/immutable_creators.c`

## CMake Updates Completed
- ✅ `tests/codegen/integration/CMakeLists.txt` - Updated to reflect deleted tests
- ✅ `tests/ffi/CMakeLists.txt` - Commented out references to deleted tests
- ✅ Symbol export CMakeLists.txt already had empty test list

## Issues Found During Build

### 1. Missing Function Declarations
The enum variant tests use functions from `codegen_test_stubs.c` but the header was deleted:
- **Fixed**: Added function declarations to `test_enum_variant_common.h`

### 2. References to Non-Existent Headers
Some test files reference headers that don't exist:
- `code_generator_instructions.h`
- `optimizer.h`
- `optimizer_cfg.h`

These appear to be for optimizer/control flow tests that are testing infrastructure that was never implemented.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. The build mostly succeeds - the enum variant tests now compile
2. Control flow tests reference non-existent optimizer infrastructure and should be reviewed

### Follow-up Actions
1. Review control flow tests to determine if they should be removed
2. Consider removing data flow and optimization test directories if they test non-existent code
3. Update documentation to reflect that only LLVM backend exists

## Build Status
- CMake configuration: ✅ Success
- Most tests build successfully
- Some tests reference non-existent optimizer infrastructure

## Total Impact
- **47 files deleted**
- **~5,000+ lines of obsolete test code removed**
- **Build system simplified**
- **Clear architectural boundary established**

// All symbol table functionality is now implemented in the specialized files:
// - semantic_symbols_core.c
// - semantic_symbols_entries.c
// - semantic_symbols_aliases.c
// - semantic_symbols_utils.c
// - semantic_symbols_stats.c

// The implementations are included via the build system to maintain
// the same public API while improving code organization.
